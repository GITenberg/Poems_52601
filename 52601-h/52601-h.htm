<h2><a name="BIOGRAPHY_AND_COMMENT" id="BIOGRAPHY_AND_COMMENT"></a>BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT</h2>

<p>In tracing the origin of <span class="smcap">John Clare</span> it is not necessary to go very far
back, reference to his grandfather and grandmother being a sufficient
acknowledgement of the claims of genealogy. Following the road at
haphazard, trusting himself entirely to the guidance of fortune, and
relying for provender upon his skill in drawing from a violin tunes of
the battle and the dance, about thirty years before Helpstone heard the
first wail of its infant poet, there arrived at the village the vagabond
and truculent Parker. Born under a wandering star, this man had footed
it through many a country of Europe, careless whether daily necessity
required from him an act of bloodshed or the scraping of a harum-scarum
reel designed to set frolic in the toes of man and maid. At the time of
his reaching Helpstone, a Northamptonshire village, destined to come
into prominence because of the lyrics of its chief son, it happened that
the children were without a schoolmaster. In his time the adventurer
had<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_x" id="page_x"></a>{x}</span> played many parts. Why should he not add to the list? Effrontery,
backed up by an uncertain amount of superficial attainment, won the day,
and this fiddling Odysseus obtained the vacant position. Of his
boastings, his bowings, his drinkings, there is no need to make history,
but his soft tongue demands a moment of attention. We may take it for
granted that he picked out the fairest flower among the maids of
Helpstone as the target for all the darts at his disposal, each of
which, we may be sure, was polished by use. The daughter of the parish
clerk was a fortress easy to capture. Depicted by himself, the rascal
loomed as a hero; till at last the affair proceeded beyond a mere kiss,
and the poor girl pleaded for the offices of a priest in order to save
her child from the stain of illegitimacy. However, the schoolmaster
proved glib of promises, but fleet of foot, for on the day following his
sweetheart’s revelations he was nowhere to be found. In the course of
time <span class="smcap">John Clare’s</span> father was born. In his turn, he grew into the want of
a mate, found her, married her, and begot an honour for England.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Clare</span> was born at Helpstone, on the 13th day of July, 1793, and
born into a heritage of handicaps. To say nothing of the fruits of
exposure to rough weathers which were ripening in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xi" id="page_xi"></a>{xi}</span> father’s system,
the boy had the disadvantage of being one of twins, a sister
accompanying him into the world. His mother suffered from dropsy, and we
may well believe that what life the children sucked from her breast
contained elements threatening their future health. Small and frail, the
lad had the additional misfortune to open his eyes in the cottage of a
pauper, instead of in some abode where his natural weakness could have
been nourished by foods giving inward encouragement, and of a sort sure
to result in the building up of hearty fibre. Despite all these early
rebuffs, <span class="smcap">John Clare</span> kept hold of life. When still very young he set out
full of faith to explore the junction of earth and heaven, for on the
horizon he could see the point of their meeting. In this incident, as
well as in many another of his childhood, it is easy to detect signs of
a spirit triumphantly unfitted for residence in a clay hovel at
Helpstone. As luck would have it, a kind of rough-and-ready poetry was
not altogether out of the boy’s reach, for his father’s head was stuffed
with innumerable odds-and-ends of rhyme, some of which he was in the
habit of reciting to his son. Entertainment of the same sort was
obtainable from old Granny Bains, a weather-worn cow-herd, to whom the
future poet was attracted by her store of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xii" id="page_xii"></a>{xii}</span> ditties; whose especial
cronies were the wind and rain. Under such illiterate tutors little <span class="smcap">John
Clare</span> moved closer and closer to the soul of poetry, musing while he put
a limit to the vagrancy of the geese and sheep for which he had been
appointed guardian as soon as the main part of his schooling was over.
His departure from the scholastic bench took place when his years had
reached a very unripe total, for with only seven birthdays entered in
his book of life, at an age when a child is usually at the commencement
of historical and geographical perplexities, he was turned out into the
fields as a wage-earner. Instead of feeling elated at his escape from
the scholastic coils of Dame Bullimore, as many a lad would have done,
<span class="smcap">John Clare</span>, being aware of his budding wits, although unable to
comprehend the motive force from within, looked round his small district
in search of fresh educational territories to be conquered by his brain.
Having saved a few pence he made overtures to Mr. James Merrishaw, the
schoolmaster of Glinton, and in the duller months of the year, when days
were short, he attended certain evening classes, notwithstanding the
fact that the journeys involved taxed his boot-leather severely; for
Glinton is nearly five miles away from Helpstone. Here he learned well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xiii" id="page_xiii"></a>{xiii}</span>
but not altogether wisely, if we may agree that the boy’s struggles with
the intricacies of algebra were conspicuous for mis-applied energy. But
something more valuable than baffling equations resulted from <span class="smcap">John
Clare’s</span> connection with the sage of Glinton, for Mr. Merrishaw made him
free of his books, thus feeding more and more that desire for knowledge
which sprang up in him not less rapidly than a mushroom grows in a
meadow.</p>

<p>Even in such a loose piece of biography as this&mdash;an essay which has no
other aim than to glance in passing at the salient features of <span class="smcap">Clare’s</span>
career&mdash;a little space must be spared for mention of the boy’s year of
service as factotum at the “Blue Bell” at Helpstone, where he had almost
as much leisure as work, because it was here that his hermitical notions
and moods of dream increased at an extraordinary rate. Served by
travelling pedlars, whose packs let him share in fancy the terror of Red
Riding Hood, the adventures of Valentine and Orson, to say no word of
Sinbad’s amazements, the small student entered for the first time into
the recesses of fairy land, there to lave his hands in its abundant
jewels, while making extortionate demands upon the swiftness of genies.
Little by little, algebra went to the wall, yielding as much to the
boy’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xiv" id="page_xiv"></a>{xiv}</span> spreading passion for Nature’s feast of grass and flowers, as for
the limitless enchantments born of imagination, since at this period the
list of impulses communicated to him by wayside blossoms, by clouds, by
winds, and by the easy ballads of thrushes, daily grew longer. The boy
began to appreciate the largeness of God’s school as compared with the
limits reigned over by Dame Bullimore and the pedagogue of Glinton; and
his increasing sense of hearing enabled him to receive into his
understanding fragments of those sermons which are preached by stones.
Hunger for expansion lived and lusted in his heart. No better example of
this fury of craving could be adduced than the story of how the young
poet entered into a combat with circumstances in order that he might
obtain a copy of Thomson’s “Seasons.” Mental agony, as well as a
superlative degree of hoarding, went to the purchase of that coveted
volume, the history of which is fully set forth in Mr. Frederick
Martin’s stimulating “Life of John Clare.” During these glowing months
the boy of genius had not ceased from utilising every chance scrap of
paper for the purpose of jotting down his exercises in rhyme. By means
of a forgivable trick he secured the verbal patronage of his father and
mother, who could not see any merit in his verses<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xv" id="page_xv"></a>{xv}</span> till he pretended
that they were the compositions of others. As poem after poem was
written their author stored them in a cranny in the wall, a retreat at
last invaded by Mrs. Clare, with the result that she was wont to help
the boiling of the kettle by burning underneath it the early pipings of
her son.</p>

<p>At this point, the youth in whose story the interest lies being sixteen
years old, Cupid, with no loss of his bright qualities after so many
centuries of exercise, comes into the recital. To <span class="smcap">John Clare</span>, who was
moving rapidly towards the full worship of all things lovely, Mary Joyce
appeared to be nobody less bewildering and enchanting than a stray from
heaven; and though he was prevented from wearing her, the dice of
Fortune falling adverse from the box, he never ceased to regard her as
his ideal. Of the many pathetic incidents of his life not the least
touching is the fact that in his years of a broken brain he cherished as
a chief delusion the belief that Mary Joyce was indeed his wife. What
the feelings of a nature so intense were when the father of his
sweetheart intervened as the proverbial slip between the cup and the
lip, we can only conjecture, though the tracing of results is easy
enough. After leaving the tankards and the horses of the “Blue Bell,”
<span class="smcap">John Clare</span> cast about him for<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xvi" id="page_xvi"></a>{xvi}</span> some other form of employment. Escaping
the pains of stone-cutting and cobbling, he succeeded in becoming a
gardener’s apprentice at Burghley Park, the seat of the Marquis of
Exeter. Parker Clare began to think that his son was born with an
invisible silver spoon in his mouth, while to <span class="smcap">John</span> eight shillings a
week, with lodging free, smacked of the robbers’ cave in the “Arabian
Nights.” In reality, this position was altogether undesirable, for the
head gardener, not content to degrade himself alone by an excessive
swallowing of stimulants, actually devoted his best efforts to make
drunkards of his pupils. Unfortunately temptation loomed large at the
very moment when <span class="smcap">Clare</span> was ripe for mischief. Romance was worsted by
swipes (the indignity of the episode may be held to excuse the slang);
by means of such thin nepenthe, regret for the loss of Mary Joyce grew
less and less; and it not infrequently occurred that the new apprentice
slept off his potations by the hedge-side, with no better blanket than a
mist, and with the damp turf for sole mattress, thus unconsciously
taking in a cargo of ague and fever for future unloading. At last <span class="smcap">Clare</span>,
in company with another lad who was anxious to show a clean pair of
heels to the abstract and concrete brutalities of his master, fled to
Grantham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xvii" id="page_xvii"></a>{xvii}</span> and thence to Newark-upon-Trent, where both the runaways
obtained work under a nurseryman. But <span class="smcap">Clare</span> was homesick; his mother’s
face was as a magnet pulling him to the familiar hovel at Helpstone; no
longer could he obey that decree of divorce from his native scenes
pronounced against him by the impalpable judge and jury of circumstance.
One day, after a terrible journey on foot, he burst into the hut of his
parents, weeping for joy to gain for his body the residence which his
spirit had occupied so long.</p>

<p>No sooner had <span class="smcap">Clare</span> returned his muscles to the various tasks of a farm
labourer than he harked back with a love greater than ever to Thomson’s
“Seasons,” reading it as he went to and from his work. The chief part of
his leisure he used for the composition of verses, an occupation which
served to fix upon him habits of timidity and shyness, especially as he
was without a single sympathiser. Because of his strange manners, his
fits of abstraction as well as of uttered enthusiasm, his appetite for
solitude, the neighbours passed from mere mockery to whispers of a mind
diseased, and even of a nature beset by the black ministers of magic.
The fact that about this time his mother, for the purposes of fuel, made
a clean sweep of his poetic accumulations did<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xviii" id="page_xviii"></a>{xviii}</span> its share to loosen his
moral control; and when his attempts at gaining encouragement from Mr.
Thomas Porter, and patronage from Lord Milton, to whom the parish clerk
of Helpstone displayed the rustic poet, failed, he betook himself, this
time of his own accord, to the drunken company of the worst livers in
the village. Much of <span class="smcap">Clare’s</span> future misery proceeded from this lapse.
Before bad example had done its utmost to ruin him, Providence, in the
somewhat unusual disguise of a recruiting sergeant, came to the rescue.
<span class="smcap">John’s</span> period of military service was brief, for after being instructed
at Oundle in the goose-step&mdash;that foundation of a glorious career under
arms&mdash;the corps of which he was a member was disbanded, and he was
enabled once more to assume the civilian smock at Helpstone. For all
booty he had a second-rate copy of “Paradise Lost” and “The Tempest.” A
matter of more importance, however, was the fact that he had departed
from the pernicious influence of the roysterers who were leading him to
destruction. A number of small adventures were not slow to follow his
short intimacy with the clothes and tools of war, what with his trial of
a gipsy’s life, and his courting of several girls, one of whom,
Elizabeth Newton by name, drove him into a fit of melancholy by playing<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xix" id="page_xix"></a>{xix}</span>
the part of a jilt. In this state of mind nothing could have suited him
better than change of scene, and his departure to Bridge Casterton,
there to learn the details of a lime-burner’s trade, happened at a
moment fortunate for heart and head alike. It was while he resided in
this neighbourhood that he confided to Mr. Henson, a bookseller of
Market Deeping, the fact of his colloquy with the Muse, following the
avowal by a display of his powers. This confession was the germ of a
wide circulation.</p>

<p>And now we are arrived at a fresh, and, as far as matrimony is
concerned, a final love. <span class="smcap">Clare</span> being now twenty-four years of age, it
was high time for him to nurse an established affection, and he was
lucky to win the heart of Martha Turner, the “Patty” of several poems to
be found in the collected works of the poet. To him Martha was another
waif from the skies, even though she tortured her poetical admirer by
the time-honoured practice of appearing to waver between two suitors.
The conduct of this episode was made up of petty events prosaic enough
to the onlooker, but sufficiently lethal for the parties most
interested. Tiffs, sour looks from parents, despairs, showers, rainbows,
were the constituents of <span class="smcap">Clare’s</span> courtship. A flat and always fortunate
wooing would doubtless have<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xx" id="page_xx"></a>{xx}</span> been hostile to poetry. Because of his
longing to supply two mouths with the necessaries of life, and because
it was clearly proved that Cupid would not even be able to munch a
satisfactory portion of crust if the lovers founded their faith solely
on the wage of a lime-burner, <span class="smcap">Clare</span> conceived the idea of publishing a
volume of song, his mind appointing Mr. Henson, of Market Deeping, a
comrade for his project. A month devoted to the base uses of the
treadmill would not have cost the poet more labour than did the
composition of his prospectus, three hundred copies of which the
bookseller agreed to print, as well as a specimen sonnet, for one pound.
But this trap for subscribers was baited with too much candour. If ever
a poet met with a crushing response to his first appeal for a hearing,
surely <span class="smcap">John Clare</span> was that man. Seven patrons came forward, more, we may
guess, in kindness than in hope of literary luxury. <span class="smcap">Clare</span>, of course,
experienced the superlatives of disgust; and when the printer of the
artless prospectus wrote to inform him that the adventure must drop
unless fifteen pounds appeared to back it up, he could not withhold
himself from replying in a strain to the last degree impolitic. To add
to his griefs, a rather wide gulf was at this time yawning between
Martha Turner and himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxi" id="page_xxi"></a>{xxi}</span> the bridging of which was a feat of
engineering extremely hard to accomplish. Moreover, and here is an
illustration of the proverb that it never rains but it pours, the owner
of the limekilns discharged his lyrical servant on the score of his
inattention to business. The whole neighbourhood being somewhat
scandalised at what was considered presumption, for labourers of <span class="smcap">Clare’s</span>
type were not required to assert themselves in prose, much less in
poetry, the disappointed lime-burner, with a heart given up to aching,
returned once more to Helpstone, where he would have starved but for
parochial relief. So genius sat down to eat the parish loaf.</p>

<p>However tightly twisted the rosebud may be, windy and sunny fingers will
unpack it at last. At the very moment when <span class="smcap">Clare</span> was reading himself as
the peculiar prey of disaster, he was destined to behold the bright back
of the cloud which had confronted him with such ominous persistence. By
strange approaches the news of <i>Clare’s</i> devotion to and production of
poetry arrived at Mr. Drury, a bookseller who was on the point of taking
over a business at Stamford from Mr. Thompson, of that town. In company
with a friend, Mr. Drury proceeded to Helpstone, interviewed the
astonished poet, glanced through some rhymed samples, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxii" id="page_xxii"></a>{xxii}</span> finally
declared his intention to publish a volume at his own risk, hearing
which intelligence <span class="smcap">Clare</span> once more rose heavenward in the balloon of
hope, forgetting how certain it was that impediments to free flight
would make themselves manifest. Owing to the offices of Mr. Drury, <span class="smcap">Clare</span>
became acquainted with Mr. Gilchrist, of Stamford, a gentlemen with an
Oxford education and a grocer’s shop, who played the part of a true
friend to the poet, if we except his action in making public some verses
of <span class="smcap">Clare’s</span> which had more wine than inspiration in them. It has been
contended that Mr. Gilchrist filled the post of patron with a want of
reserve which made <span class="smcap">Clare</span> feel his position acutely; for the eating of
humble-pie has never been a really popular amusement. Be this as it may,
lovers of “Poems descriptive of Rural Life and Scenery” have a great
deal for which to thank Mr. Gilchrist. After promising <span class="smcap">Clare</span> to
undertake the publication of his first book, Mr. Drury experienced a few
bad hours. To begin with, the ill-spelt, rope-tied, unpunctuated mass of
manuscript entrusted to him by its author had a most unpromising aspect.
He tested it as best he could, but, as the glow of the adventure had
already faded a little, found no particular reasons for comfort. In this
strait he enlisted the acumen of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxiii" id="page_xxiii"></a>{xxiii}</span> acquaintance, a clergyman, whose
name was, somewhat appropriately, Twopenny, in order to see how the
verses might strike a contemporary. The prophetic Twopenny, with brutal
candour, described <span class="smcap">Clare’s</span> bundle of reeds to be so much twaddle. When
Mr. Drury delivered this oracle, the grief of the poet was such that the
bookseller was shocked. Had it not been for the anguish of the singer,
it is quite possible that the bookseller of Stamford would have
departed, with decent circuity, from his bargain; as it was, he
determined to procure yet another opinion. He happened to be a relative
of Mr. John Taylor, the London publisher, to whom he despatched the
uncouth manuscript in question. Mr. Taylor’s were not as Mr. Twopenny’s
eyes. He knew diamonds when he saw them, even though a polisher had not
exerted his craft upon them.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to describe the effect made on the public by the
appearance of “Poems descriptive of Rural Life and Scenery,” it will be
necessary to revert for a moment to the affairs of love. No sooner was
the first quarrel between the sweethearts swept away by the broom of
reconciliation than the flame of passion, burning to a conquering
height, made a bonfire out of the broken materials of virtue. This
disaster was followed by fresh bickerings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxiv" id="page_xxiv"></a>{xxiv}</span> Martha Turner found it
impossible to be for ever displaying a cheerful front. Her tears, her
reproaches, her simple tricks to make <span class="smcap">Clare</span> jealous, resulted in a
serious breach. <span class="smcap">Clare</span>, listening far too readily to glib and evil
persuasions from within, appears to have convinced himself that he was
the injured party; whereupon he began to wound Martha by flirting
outrageously with Betty Sell, the daughter of a Southorp labourer. This
inglorious behaviour received a sudden check, just after the publication
of <span class="smcap">Clare’s</span> book, by reason of a letter from Martha Turner, in which she
spoke of her coming motherhood, and implored the author of her shame to
cleanse her in so far as he was able. Truth to tell, <span class="smcap">Clare</span> was by this
time wellnigh assured that Betty was his favourite, but he had the
manliness to follow the right star, and on the 16th of March, 1820, was
united to Martha at Great Casterton Church. A month after the wedding
Anna Maria Clare was born to him. As this marriage would hardly have
been possible but for the stir occasioned by the poems, we may now give
a short history of the events immediately following their issue.</p>

<p>Although the art of preliminary puffing was as yet in swaddling clothes,
so to speak, Mr. Taylor contrived to interest a large number of his
acquaintances, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxv" id="page_xxv"></a>{xxv}</span> of whom had access to the columns of certain
periodicals. Moreover, Mr. Gilchrist’s magazine article had proved a
useful forerunner. The book itself was born into a golden clime. The
reading world happening to be sick of Metropolitan and modish fare,
<span class="smcap">Clare’s</span> birds and mayblossoms came as a tonic to all who were desirous
of a change. The triumph of the country over the town was of the
completest sort; customers poured into Mr. Taylor’s shop in their
anxiety to purchase copies of the labourer’s poems; for once the critics
and the public were agreed. Journals of fine stature joined with
insignificant prints in praising <span class="smcap">Clare</span> to the skies, and when this new
writer actually succeeded in carrying the defences of the “Quarterly,”
it was allowed on all sides that lion-hunters were in luck’s way. <span class="smcap">Clare</span>
was fortunate in some of his advertisers. Rossini and Madame Vestris
brought him into further prominence by means of a musical setting and of
recitations at Covent Garden. Genius in hobnailed boots and a
smock-frock shouldered aside the more usual figures of literary London.
While all this was taking place in Fleet Street, as well as in the
aristocratic sections of the capital, rumours of <span class="smcap">Clare’s</span> amazing success
reached the county residences in the neighbourhood<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxvi" id="page_xxvi"></a>{xxvi}</span> of Helpstone.
General Birch Reynardson gave him to eat with his lackeys, and Viscount
Milton flung seventeen guineas into his lap with as much feeling as he
might have thrown seventeen crumbs to a cur. In great contrast to
blue-blooded vulgarity of this stamp was the Marquis of Exeter’s
treatment of the poet, although a more liberal display of tact upon his
part would have enabled <span class="smcap">Clare</span> to leave his mansion with a heart given
over completely to joy and gratitude. Friends of <i>Clare</i> are not likely
to forget the generosity of the Marquis. An annuity of fifteen guineas
for life was indeed a handsome backing of the Muse. Because of this gift
Anna Maria Clare was born in wedlock; without it her parents would not
have been able to marry as soon as they did. Foolish folk spared the
poet none of the customary agonies. He was pestered by inquisitive
visitors; collectors of autographs bullied him for his signature, and
the owners of albums plagued him to encourage them in their whim. Some
persons of the goody-goody type improved the shining hour by sending him
an assortment of tracts, the fate of which is wrapped in impenetrable
mystery. <span class="smcap">Clare</span> was a simple child of nature, certainly, but we may
almost take it for granted that he left these precious effusions
undigested.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxvii" id="page_xxvii"></a>{xxvii}</span></p>

<p>The news that <span class="smcap">Clare</span> was about to trust his bones to London almost
paralysed his rustic intimates. Generations of romancers had made
strange impressions upon the provincial mind. Particularly full of
odious vaticinations was James Burridge, an old farm labourer whose head
was stuffed to the bursting point with stories horrifying enough to make
<span class="smcap">Clare’s</span> flesh creep. According to this authority, London thoroughly
deserved the doubtful compliment of being compared with Babylon. He
declared that there were trap-doors in the streets, down which wayfarers
flopped into cauldrons of boiling water amid the plaudits of ministering
cut-throats! <span class="smcap">Clare</span> quailed, his parents wept, and his wife approached
within measurable distance of hysterics. But even the prospect of being
cooked in this casual manner did not suffice to deter the poet from
visiting Mr. Taylor, of Fleet Street. That he set some value upon the
legends of James Burridge is proved by his adoption of a small device to
baffle the trapdoor operators. Believing safety to be resident in a
smock-frock and in boots the soles of which sustained grinning rows of
hobnails, he set forth upon his journey thus attired. He was not long in
regretting his precautions, for he soon perceived that his costume
evoked from onlookers merry comments<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxviii" id="page_xxviii"></a>{xxviii}</span> and derisive glances. In the end,
Mr. Taylor supplied him with an overcoat which covered the defects of
his attire. Whatever the heat of theatre or drawing-room, whether among
lords or commoners, <span class="smcap">John Clare</span> clung to this garment with the courage of
despair. What his agonies were, because of his raiment, when driven into
a corner by a countess for a <i>tête-à-tête</i>, we can do no more than dimly
conjecture. In the course of this visit <span class="smcap">Clare</span> was introduced to Admiral
Lord Radstock, who took a great fancy to him and remained a firm friend,
and to Mrs. Emmerson, a lady who, seeing that her purse and sympathies
were always ready to alleviate the mischances of young poets and
artists, might be described as a female Maecenas. To this rather gushing
and sentimental patroness of the arts <span class="smcap">Clare</span> from time to time addressed
letters which were not devoid of the elements of wildness and Platonic
passion. At last his emphasis became so absurd that Mrs. Emmerson
requested him to send back her portrait. Had a jug of cold water been
poured down the poet’s neck he could not have been more cooled than he
was by this piece of diplomacy. The shrine was despoiled. The picture
was despatched by the next carrier; and doubtless Martha, who must have
hated the sight of Mrs. Emmerson’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxix" id="page_xxix"></a>{xxix}</span> face, congratulated herself in
secret. There is no need to say more about <span class="smcap">Clare’s</span> first visit to
London, if we except mention of the fact that the mighty city’s chief
effect upon him was to fill his breast with yearning for the oaks and
rivulets round about his native village. A week in the Metropolis had
been more than enough for the countryman. As he rumbled homeward in the
coach, he had dreams of unsullied waters and unsmoked rainbows; and he
counted over his country joys as a miser adds up the total of his
various coins. At the top of his treasures stood his wife and baby, for,
with all his Platonic declensions from the state most comfortable to
Martha, he was an affectionate husband and father. About this time
several hearty friends strove with might and main to secure a competence
for the poet. A sum of four hundred and twenty pounds was the result of
their earnestness; but when it is remembered that Earl Fitzwilliam and
<span class="smcap">Clare’s</span> publishers were between them responsible for no less than two
hundred of this amount, the harvest of solicitation is not notable for
bounteousness. Dr. Bell&mdash;a friend of the right complexion&mdash;extracted an
annual ten pounds from Earl Spencer, so that, what with this gift, the
Marquis of Exeter’s donation, and the fund, the genius of Helpstone was
possessed of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxx" id="page_xxx"></a>{xxx}</span> an income of forty-five pounds per annum. <span class="smcap">Clare</span> felt a
very mendicant throughout all these transactions, and even went so far
as to disavow them in letters despatched to his noble helpers. Had it
not been for the persuasions of Mr. Gilchrist and the amusing invectives
of Dr. Bell, he would have kicked with greater persistence against the
pricks of charity.</p>

<p>As soon as the harvest was over, <span class="smcap">Clare</span> made an end of labouring in the
fields. He was under agreement to hand over another volume of poetry to
Messrs. Taylor and Hessey for publication early in 1821. It was now his
earnest endeavour to fulfil his share of the bargain, and he bared his
forehead to inspiration. <span class="smcap">Clare</span> always felt himself cheated and empty of
ideas when shut up within four walls. The Muse would not follow him to
his fireside, but she would frolic with him the live-long day in the
open air, filling him with buoyancy, kissing his lips, and smoothing out
his wrinkles. Seated inside an old oak, whose heart had gradually passed
into the atmosphere, <span class="smcap">Clare</span> was wont to pour his soul in song, and so
fruitful were the hints of his unseen companion that he soon had a great
collection of new verses. All that he approved he desired to publish,
but Mr. Taylor spoke a few strong words in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxxi" id="page_xxxi"></a>{xxxi}</span> favour of weeding,
suggesting to <span class="smcap">Clare</span> that he should play the part of Herod toward some of
the children of his imagination. A deadlock ensued. For a time the poet
was adamant, the publishers marble. In this difficulty <span class="smcap">Clare</span> bethought
himself of Mr. Gilchrist as an excellent agent for the casting of oil on
the troubled waters. This gentleman, however, was thick in a squabble of
his own, and when <span class="smcap">Clare</span> appeared unsympathetic he displayed a spirit
very much huffed. At last the tension between poet and publishers became
less, with the result that in the middle of September “The Village
Minstrel” was ready for purchasers. The two volumes were handsomely
presented; the type was beautiful, and a couple of steel engravings made
a brave show. Despite the attractions of genius, despite the various
ornaments, “The Village Minstrel” met with rather an icy greeting. Among
the several explanations of this coldness put forward by the publishers
and by certain friends, the likeliest is that the season of issue was
not wisely chosen. In this year such gods of the pen as Scott, Byron,
Shelley, Wordsworth, Keats, and Lamb distributed joy to many a reader,
so that poor <span class="smcap">John Clare</span> naturally ran a great risk of being overlooked.
It was now proved how dangerous had been the heat of his first welcome.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxxii" id="page_xxxii"></a>{xxxii}</span>
Superlatives had been done to death; the lion-hunters had exhausted
their treacly compliments, and were now eagerly scanning the literary
horizon in the hope of seeing approach a fresh victim. Moreover, some
injudicious persons had descanted more upon <span class="smcap">Clare’s</span> poverty than upon
his remarkable powers. It was the general opinion, as Mr. Martin points
out in his biography, that a really capable poet should be able to
support himself. If he did not succeed in so doing, then he was but a
dabbler while pretending to be a priest. The logic was of the sort to
shrink from scrutiny, but it contented the shallow sufficiently well. To
my thinking, the charge of twelve shillings for these two volumes was a
factor in the neglect which overtook them. Be this as it may, a
collection of verse containing some exquisite and lovely pieces, and
marking in some respects an advance upon the forerunning book, fell upon
the stony patch of indifference, there to remain while verse of fifty
times less merit enjoyed a vogue out of proportion to its worth. In a
word, <span class="smcap">Clare’s</span> second luck was the exact opposite of his first. In days
saddened by the reflection that he had failed to hold by the glory which
he obtained at his first venture, it was balm to <span class="smcap">Clare</span> to know that
Robert Bloomfield at<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxxiii" id="page_xxxiii"></a>{xxxiii}</span> least warmly approved of what lukewarm triflers
failed to appreciate.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1821, not long after the meteoric appearance at
Helpstone of a minor poet, who presented <span class="smcap">Clare</span> with a sonnet and a
one-pound note in a glorious burst of bounty and condescension, Mr. John
Taylor passed a few hours in the little Northamptonshire village. Under
the guidance of <span class="smcap">Clare</span> he reviewed many of the spots which the poet had
celebrated in song, and, in some cases, he was amazed to find how <span class="smcap">Clare</span>
had compelled dull localities to yield strains both abundant and
beautiful. But to gather roses in a desert is child’s play for a genius.
Upon taking leave, Mr. Taylor invited <span class="smcap">Clare</span> to spend a few weeks in
Fleet Street. Luckily the poet decided to avail himself of this offer,
for about this time he was far too frequent a visitor at the “Blue
Bell,” where he had his corner reserved, and passed for the chief of the
assembly. This meant more than sufficient exercise for the gullet. The
bad habit contracted at Burghley Hall was strengthened at these
sittings, and <span class="smcap">Clare</span>, deplorably unstable in some mental particulars,
approached nearer and nearer to that abyss which has engulfed so many
great wits. The winter being over, <span class="smcap">Clare</span> departed for London. He was
something of a bolt from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxxiv" id="page_xxxiv"></a>{xxxiv}</span> blue to Mr. Taylor, but that gentleman was
not slow in welcoming his client, though he looked askance at the gay
pocket handkerchief in which was contained the whole of his friend’s
luggage. As the publisher was very busy, he delivered <span class="smcap">Clare</span> into the
keeping of Thomas Hood, who, in turn, handed him over to the head porter
of the firm. The poet was not long in finding his way to the house of
Mrs. Emmerson, whose hospitality was as frank and unstinted as ever.
Here <span class="smcap">Clare</span> met Mr. Rippingille, a young artist with a dash of Dick
Swiveller in him, who had a strong appetite for noisy pranks. In company
with this unreflective spirit the peasant from the Midlands attended
some very dubious functions, penetrating to quarters of the Metropolis
which were famous for the topmost achievements of rascality, where he
ran riot among various intoxicants. After besieging a certain beauteous
actress with all the languishing glances at their command, these foolish
comrades would pledge her in pale ale till, like Byron, they seemed to
walk upon the ceiling. Thus were buttresses added to <span class="smcap">Clare’s</span> unfortunate
predilection. Those who revel by gaslight are not fond of returning home
before midnight, and <span class="smcap">Clare</span> was no exception to the rule. But the hours
of his choice were not grateful to Mr. Taylor, whose sense of the
fitness of things was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxxv" id="page_xxxv"></a>{xxxv}</span> offended by his visitor’s conduct. Therefore,
Thomas Hood was deputed to inform <span class="smcap">Clare</span> that he was vexing his host, an
intimation which resulted in the poet carrying his handkerchief full of
belongings to Mrs. Emmerson’s house, where his manners did not improve.
Under the accomplished tuition of Mr. Rippingille he found how easy the
descent of Avernus was. His next move was to Chiswick, where the Rev. H.
T. Cary entertained him. His stay here was brief, owing to an amusing
episode. Strangely enough <span class="smcap">Clare</span> was ignorant of the fact that his
elderly host had a young and handsome wife. In the belief that he was
doing homage to the charms of one of Mr. Cary’s grown-up daughters, he
addressed several poems, which were not without the quality of ardour,
to the wife of the translator’s bosom. After this, although his
explanation was accepted and understood, <span class="smcap">Clare</span> thought he had better
depart from Chiswick. During this stay in London the Northamptonshire
poet was introduced to William Gifford and Charles Lamb, the latter of
whom, if report may be trusted, was guilty of a rather coarse jape at
his expense. Not long after this, <span class="smcap">Clare</span> returned to Helpstone. It is
worthy to note that, whereas his first visit to London had only
accentuated his country raptures, the village minstrel now<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxxvi" id="page_xxxvi"></a>{xxxvi}</span> actually
pined for the fatted calves, the theatres, the glitter, and the merry
companions of the city. The taint of Rippingille was upon him. Reaction
came in time; the meadows captured him again; but this small piece of
history is significant of much.</p>

<p>As soon as he was once more in possession of his best self, <span class="smcap">Clare</span> began
to face his troubles&mdash;most of which sprang from insufficient means at
this time&mdash;with as much courage as he could summon. He was rather slow
in being convinced that he could not derive a steady income from the
composition of poetry; but when this truth was driven home his mind at
once became agile in devising numberless plans for the betterment of his
state, for he suffered from a torturing anxiety when he remembered for
how many his fate had appointed him the bread-winner. He was now
fighting hand to hand with poverty, valorous in behalf of his aged
mother, his wife, and his little children, who enjoyed the fruits of
whatsoever victories were gained far more than did their defender&mdash;since
he secretly starved himself in order to increase the tale of loaves
presided over by Patty. In the year 1823, worn out by his failures to
extract a supporting flow of guineas from either poetry or agriculture,
he fell very ill, just after the shock occasioned by the death of Mr.
Gilchrist. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxxvii" id="page_xxxvii"></a>{xxxvii}</span> recovery was of the slowest, and it was not till he was
put by Mr. Taylor under the care of Dr. Darling, in London, that the
poet mended in a manner to satisfy his friends. It was during this third
visit to the Metropolis that <span class="smcap">Clare</span> came in contact with De Quincey,
Coleridge, William Hazlitt, and Allan Cunningham, to mention only four
of the prominent men whom Mr. Taylor delighted to make members of his
evening parties. <span class="smcap">Clare</span> found his imaginary portraits to be very
deceptive, especially so in the case of De Quincey. The bulk and dull
appearance of Coleridge also surprised, as well as disappointed, him,
for he had pictured the great man in a guise completely opposite to
reality. There is little need to say that in Mr. Taylor’s house nothing
of a bacchanalian tinge was likely to occur; but even the moderate
pleasures of the publisher’s entertainments threatened to destroy the
good brought about by the skill and care of Dr. Darling, and therefore
Clare was induced to return to Helpstone, where he once more renewed his
search for employment, encountered thoughtless snubs from the high and
mighty of the district, and gradually approached the line which
separates mental health from mental disease. He was for ever engaged in
keeping the wolf from the door. He did not eat a due share of what his
means<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxxviii" id="page_xxxviii"></a>{xxxviii}</span> supplied, denying himself from day to day with a rigidity which
could not fail to injure both body and brain. At the end of the year
1825, after working in the cornfields throughout the harvest, <span class="smcap">Clare</span>
turned to the composition of poetry, and produced “The Shepherd’s
Calendar,” a volume in which he used the file to excellent purpose.
Already bruised and wounded by the rough edges of life, the poet found
an additional hardship in the fact that Mr. Taylor long delayed to
publish this third book of verse; for to make both ends meet was now a
miracle beyond his accomplishing. Although several editors of those
elegant annuals which were then so much in favour had asked <span class="smcap">Clare</span> to
assist in making their sugary volumes attractive, they were by no means
quick to send him the money he had earned. He had only his annuity and a
few shillings gained by doing odd jobs for the farmers of the
neighbourhood. At this juncture Patty bore him a third child.</p>

<p>In 1828 <span class="smcap">Clare</span> went to London again at the invitation of Mrs. Emmerson,
and it was then that he discovered how completely the “Shepherd’s
Calendar” had failed to stir the interest of the public. It was during
this visit that Mr. Taylor, doubtless believing the open-air exercise
would be most beneficial to the poet, suggested to <span class="smcap">Clare</span> the
advisability<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxxix" id="page_xxxix"></a>{xxxix}</span> of his attempting to dispose of his works by carrying them
from house to house in Northamptonshire and the adjoining counties.
Allan Cunningham was furious at the idea, but in the end <span class="smcap">Clare</span> embraced
it, though it had been better for him had he held the same opinion as
his friend, for the adventure was prolific of more kicks than halfpence.
The history of this part of <span class="smcap">Clare’s</span> career makes very sad reading.
Hungry and footsore he tramped from rebuff to rebuff, pondering misery
and dreading the workhouse. But though the record of his travels is, for
the most part, a document of disaster, there are a few proofs of
kindliness contained in its pages. For example, when he returned to
Helpstone from Boston, where certain of the leading inhabitants had done
their best to render him extremely uncomfortable, he found ten
sovereigns in his wallet. A few young men had treated him as Joseph
treated his brethren. For three months after his experiences at Boston,
<span class="smcap">Clare</span> was exceedingly ill, and it looked as if there was to be no ebbing
of that tide of misfortune which had flowed in his direction for so
long. Better luck, however, was in store. <span class="smcap">Clare</span> got some regular work to
do, and was thus prevented from poring over foolscap. Little by little
he reduced his debts; his body throve in the sunshine of content; and he
was able<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xl" id="page_xl"></a>{xl}</span> to comfort himself with the belief that, after all, he would
escape the degradation of becoming a pauper. Unfortunately a hard winter
followed the summer and autumn during which he had been so happy, and
illness once more caused him to renew acquaintance with those bitter
familiars of his&mdash;want and despair. About this time he chanced to have a
conversation with Earl Fitzwilliam, with the result that his patron
promised to build him a cottage somewhere near Helpstone. The exact
place decided upon by his lordship was Northborough, a hamlet three
miles distant from Helpstone. This situation was chosen in a spirit of
kindness, the earl believing that the many natural beauties to be found
almost at the door of the cottage would please the eye as well as
stimulate the genius of the poet. But the prospect of being severed from
the bleak surroundings of his native place filled <span class="smcap">Clare</span> with sensations
of terror acute enough to make a severe effect upon his mind. For days
before the final wrench came he strode about the lanes and fields,
outwardly exhibiting symptoms of a deranged intellect; but when the hour
for departure struck he allowed himself to be led to his new home as
placidly as a tired horse to the pasture. So far from proving a blessing
to <span class="smcap">Clare</span>, the cottage at Northborough was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xli" id="page_xli"></a>{xli}</span> immediate cause of fresh
perplexities. Expenditure was necessary to furnish it and to keep it in
repair; debts were quickly piled one upon the other; among strangers it
was harder to obtain employment than it had been at Helpstone; and in
the January of 1833 Patty bore her seventh child. At the thought that he
could scarcely provide his dear ones with bread enough to keep body and
soul together, <span class="smcap">Clare</span>, shortly after hearing the news of his boy’s birth,
rushed out into the fields to give his sorrow vent. Late in the evening
his eldest daughter found him lying insensible on an embankment. A month
of bed followed this collapse. In the spring, although his vital forces
were now sufficient to carry him in search of the early flowers, he
showed no inclination to leave the little room where he kept his books
and papers. The irresistible magnets of former years&mdash;blossoms, birds,
greenery and sunshine&mdash;had all lost their pulling power. <span class="smcap">Clare</span> himself
perceived that he was in danger of ceasing to be his own master, and
accordingly wrote to Mr. Taylor begging him to secure Dr. Darling’s
help. In reply, his old publisher invited him to London. But the poet
neither had money in his purse nor a single chance of raising the amount
necessary to defray the costs of the journey. Messrs. Whittaker &amp; Co.,
who were responsible<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xlii" id="page_xlii"></a>{xlii}</span> for the appearance of the “Rural Muse,” declined
to send him even a small sum on account, so that he was tied fast to
Northborough, where his mental malady had everything in its favour. Had
it not been for the untiring exertions of Dr. Smith, of Peterborough,
who mingled poetry and pills in his advice to patients, thus obtaining a
goodly list of subscribers, it is doubtful whether the “Rural Muse”
would have made its appearance before <span class="smcap">Clare</span> was overcome by permanent
imbecility. In the summer of 1835 this beautiful collection of rustic
reeds was put forward as a candidate for the affection of those
professing a love for music and wholesomeness in verse. The reception
accorded to the book proved conclusively what important parts fashion
and hypocrisy play in the concerns of the lyre. <span class="smcap">Clare</span> was out of vogue;
he was a stale lion; the parasites upon genius could no longer hope to
gain a temporary notoriety by displaying his peculiarities in their
saloons. The idea of reading poetry for the sake of poetry appears never
to have occurred to the members of a society as ponderable, in the
matter of intellect, as thistledown, and as variable as the sheen of an
opal. It is a moot point whether or no the reviewers wrote notices of
the “Rural Muse.” If they did their duty, the editors certainly did not
back<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xliii" id="page_xliii"></a>{xliii}</span> them up by granting space for the criticisms, for scarcely a
paragraph of commendation saw the light. If <span class="smcap">Clare</span> did not fall among
thieves, he at least fell among blind bats. Literary England blotted her
own escutcheon in this respect, but Scotland was saved from a similar
disgrace by a noble outburst of praise for the poet, and scorn for his
frigid countrymen, from the pen of Professor Wilson, in the course of
which he adjured the Southrons to hold their tongues about the fate of
Burns. Let them remember Bloomfield. Had he but known all the evil
circumstances which were combining to push <span class="smcap">John Clare</span> in the direction
of a lunatic asylum, his retort would have been strengthened to a degree
melancholy to contemplate.</p>

<p>Mental derangement advanced upon <span class="smcap">Clare</span> with rapidity. In the spring of
1836 there was a brief period when the flowers made him a clear-minded
partaker of their magic, but the improvement was not maintained, and
little by little the condition of the poet became more widley known,
till at last it reached the ears of several patrons. These advised his
immediate removal to the asylum at Northampton, a plan to which Patty
refused her consent, for she still had hopes that if her husband were
allowed to range at his will and seek a cure from the pharmacy<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xliv" id="page_xliv"></a>{xliv}</span> of
nature, he would beat the disease. But Patty’s love only delayed the
inevitable. <span class="smcap">Clare</span>, it is true, escaped from the control suggested by
Earl Fitzwilliam, who endeavoured to place the poet at Northampton,
where a weekly dole from the nobleman’s purse would secure for the
patient some additional comforts; but he had nowhither to fly from the
severe benefactions of the friends of former days. Mr. John Taylor and
others, willing to heed now that the catastrophe to which their silence
had contributed was come by its full dimensions, clubbed together and
sent <span class="smcap">Clare</span> to Dr. Allen’s private lunatic asylum in Epping Forest, where
all the resources of a humane treatment were brought to bear upon his
case. He wrote a great quantity of verse, some of which was of real
worth; tended the flowers in the garden beds; wandered about the woods
hour after hour, smoking, musing, or conversing with some companion. In
the middle of July, 1841, he escaped, and eventually reached Werrington,
a hamlet lying beyond Peterborough. His chief food had been grass; blood
was trickling from his feet when Patty took the wanderer into her arms
on the roadside at Werrington. After a day’s rest at Northborough, the
poet asked for pen and ink. When these were supplied he commenced to
write his Odyssey. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xlv" id="page_xlv"></a>{xlv}</span> almost safe to say that no more extraordinary
a document belongs to the personal history of any genius born within our
boundaries. It is of a character to draw tears from the unsympathetic;
your Scrooge, your Quilp, could scarcely withstand its pathos. Well
might Christopher North request us to be done with our comments upon
Scotland’s usage of Burns!</p>

<p>The rest is soon told. <span class="smcap">Clare</span>, though quite harmless, was not allowed to
pass free among the country sights and sounds. For some reason or other
he was haled to the Northampton General Lunatic Asylum, where he
remained for twenty-two years, neglected alike by kindred, by friends,
and by the educated mob which had once made an idol of him. At the
Asylum he was treated with unvarying mildness by the authorities, who
refused to regulate the comforts of the poet by the eleven shillings a
week supplied by Earl Fitzwilliam. That their natures were not
subservient to coinage they proved by placing <span class="smcap">Clare</span>&mdash;poor,
eleven-shillings-a-week <span class="smcap">John Clare</span>&mdash;among private patients in the best
ward.</p>

<p>The end came in 1864, and on the 25th of May in that year the mortal
remnant of <span class="smcap">John Clare</span>, peasant and poet, was interred at Helpstone. When
Earl Fitzwilliam was asked for a grant of the few pounds necessary for
the burial of the poet in the churchyard<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xlvi" id="page_xlvi"></a>{xlvi}</span> so beloved by him during his
lifetime, he responded by suggesting that the funeral should be that of
a pauper at Northampton. However, a few friends of the right heart
prevented this disgrace, and the body rested where the soul had marked
out for it a spot of greenery and quietude.</p>

<p>That some of <span class="smcap">Clare’s</span> poems belong of right to the excellent things of
this earth admits of no dispute. A worshipper of Nature, by whom he was
surely appointed to be one of her chief historians, he revelled in her
manifestations, whether they showed in the higher heaven of blue or in
the lower heaven of green. He was, if the phrases may pass muster, a
gossip of the rainbow, a crony of the flowers. His heart was not less
slow than that of Wordsworth to leap up with joy when he beheld standing
across the sky, its feet treading the horizon, the most splendid
triumphal arch ever devised; and though it was not granted him to render
homage to his mistress in such large accents as those which fell from
the lips of his great brother in song, he paid for her love and favours
in music far from perishable, as may be noted by all who will read the
pieces that have been selected for this volume from the “Rural Muse.”
Who passes by any one of these poems because he early finds a flaw, does
so at his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xlvii" id="page_xlvii"></a>{xlvii}</span> danger, for each of them belongs, as I venture to assert,
so indubitably to the particular treasures of pastoral poetry that I
doubt whether the contradiction of our greatest critics could frighten
me from the attitude of admiration. To influences other than those of
the countryside, <span class="smcap">Clare</span> remained unimpressionable. To be in London was to
long for Helpstone, the commons and pools of which were more precious to
the poet than all the glories of Westminster Abbey, and the expanses of
the artificial lakes. While he sojourned in the Metropolis the right
spark would not fall from heaven, but as soon as he wandered once more
among the scenes so long familiar to him, the Muse was his unfailing
companion. Brooks glided in his songs; birds and clouds and leafage were
foundations without which he had been well-nigh powerless. He
understood, and was content with, his limits; and so perfectly did he
accomplish his duty as Nature’s cherished amanuensis, that it is no hard
task for a man with an ounce of imagination in his being to hear the
trickle of streams, and to fancy his study carpeted with grass, while
reading <span class="smcap">John Clare’s</span> poems within four walls. As this volume of
selections is designed for the purpose of attracting readers to a poet
whose appreciative receipts from his posterity are sadly deficient in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xlviii" id="page_xlviii"></a>{xlviii}</span>
quantity, the publisher has thought well to ask from me the tale of
<span class="smcap">Clare’s</span> life, rather than my views of the poet’s work and its effect
upon his successors in the production of poetry dealing almost
exclusively with the vowels and consonants in Nature’s mighty alphabet.
Enough has been said to prove the writer no half-hearted advocate; and
if these few pages serve to increase the number of <span class="smcap">Clare’s</span> friends, he
will be more than satisfied, happy in the thought that he has been the
means of introducing readers to poetry as gentle as it is healing, as
simple as it is sincere. Touching its wholesomeness, how could it fail
to delight in this respect when the chief of its constituent parts were
the large and lovely expressions of Nature’s handicraft? <span class="smcap">John Clare’s</span>
gift fell upon him direct from the skies. It came clean; and clean he
kept it from the beginning to the end of his stewardship.</p>

<span class="i0"><span class="letra">O</span><small>N</small> Sunday mornings, freed from hard employ,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How oft I mark the mischievous young boy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With anxious haste his pole and lines provide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For make-shifts oft crook’d pins to thread were tied;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And delve his knife with wishes ever warm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In rotten dunghills for the grub and worm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The harmless treachery of his hooks to bait;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tracking the dewy grass with many a mate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To seek the brook that down the meadows glides,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the grey willow shadows by its sides,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where flag and reed in wild disorder spread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bending bulrush bows its taper head;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, just above the surface of the floods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where water-lilies mount their snowy buds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On whose broad swimming leaves of glossy green<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shining dragon-fly is often seen:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where hanging thorns, with roots wash’d bare, appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That shield the moor-hen’s nest from year to year;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While crowding osiers mingling wild among<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prove snug asylums to her brood when young,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, when surpris’d by foes approaching near,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_62" id="page_62"></a>{62}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plunge ’neath the weeping boughs and disappear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There far from terrors that the parson brings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or church bell hearing when its summons rings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half hid in meadow-sweet and keck’s high flowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In lonely sport they spend the Sunday hours.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though ill supplied for fishing seem the brook,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That breaks the mead in many a stinted crook,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft choak’d in weeds, and foil’d to find a road,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The choice retirement of the snake and toad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then lost in shallows dimpling restlessly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In fluttering struggles murmuring to be free,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O’er gravel stones its depth can scarcely hide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It runs remnant of its broken tide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till, seemly weary of each choak’d control,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It rests collected in some gulled hole<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scoop’d by the sudden floods when winter’s snow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Melts in confusion by a hasty thaw;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There bent in hopeful musings on the brink<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They watch their floating corks that seldom sink,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save when a wary roach or silver bream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nibbles the worm as passing up the stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just urging expectation’s hopes to stay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To view the dodging cork, then slink away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still hopes keep burning with untir’d delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still wobbling curves keep wavering like a bite:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If but the breezy wind their floats should spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And move the water with a troubling ring,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_63" id="page_63"></a>{63}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A captive fish still fills the anxious eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And willow-wicks lie ready for the prize;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till evening gales awaken damp and chill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nip the hopes that morning suns instil;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And resting flies have tired their gauzy wing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor longer tempt the watching fish to spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who at the worm no nibbles more repeat,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then disappointed in their day’s employ,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They seek amusement in a feebler joy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Short is the sigh for fancies prov’d untrue:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With humbler hopes still pleasure they pursue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the rude oak-bridge scales the narrow pass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half hid in rustling reeds and scrambling grass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or stepping stones stride o’er the narrow sloughs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which maidens daily cross to milk their cows;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There they in artless glee for minnows run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wade and dabble past the setting sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chasing the struttle o’er the shallow tide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flat stones turning up where gudgeons hide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All former hopes their ill success delay’d,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this new change they fancy well repaid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus they wade, and chatter o’er their joys<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till night, unlook’d-for, young success destroys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drives home the sons of solitude and streams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stops uncloy’d hope’s ever-fresh’ning dreams.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They then, like school-boys that at truant play,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_64" id="page_64"></a>{64}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sloomy fear lounge on their homeward way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And inly tremble, as they gain the town,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where chastisement awaits with many a frown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hazel twigs, in readiness prepar’d,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For their long absence brings a meet reward.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The rest the loud laugh raise, to make it known,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She blushes silent, and will not disown!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus ale, and song, and healths, and merry ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keep up a shadow still of former days;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the old beechen bowl, that once supplied<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the old freedom that was living then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When masters made them merry with their men;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When all their coats alike were russet brown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his rude speech was vulgar as their own&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All this is past, and soon will pass away<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Hark! there she is as usual&mdash;let’s be hush&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in this black-thorn clump, if rightly guest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her curious house is hidden. Part aside<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These hazel branches in a gentle way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stoop right cautious ’neath the rustling boughs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For we will have another search to-day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hunt this fern-strewn thorn-clump round and round;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_116" id="page_116"></a>{116}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where this reeded wood-grass idly bows,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In such like spots, and often on the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They’ll build, where rude boys never think to look&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aye, as I live! her secret nest is here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon this white-thorn stump! I’ve searched about<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For hours in vain. There! put that bramble by&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, trample on its branches and get near.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How subtle is the bird! she started out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And raised a plaintive note of danger nigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere we were past the brambles; and now, near<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her nest, she sudden stops&mdash;as choking fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That might betray her home. So even now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We’ll leave it as we found it; safety’s guard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of pathless solitude shall keep it still.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See there; she’s sitting on the old oak bough,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mute in her fears; our presence doth retard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her joys, and doubt turns every rapture chill.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sing on, sweet bird! may no worse hap befall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy visions, than the fear that now deceives.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We will not plunder music of its dower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor turn this spot of happiness to thrall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For melody seems hid in every flower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That blossoms near thy home. These harebells all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seem bowing with the beautiful in song;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gaping cuckoo-flowers, with spotted leaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seems blushing of the singing it has heard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_117" id="page_117"></a>{117}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">How curious is the nest; no other bird<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uses such loose materials, or weaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its dwelling in such spots: dead open leaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are placed without, and velvet moss within,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And little scraps of grass, and, scant and spare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What scarcely seem materials, down and hair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For from men’s haunts she nothing seems to win.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet Nature is the builder, and contrives<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Homes for her children’s comfort, even here;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Solitude’s disciples spend their lives<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unseen, save when a wanderer passes near<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That loves such pleasant places. Deep adown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nest is made a hermit’s mossy cell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Snug lie her curious eggs in number five,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of deadened green, or rather olive brown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the old prickly thorn-bush guards them well.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So here we’ll leave them, still unknown to wrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the old woodland’s legacy of song.<br /></span>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

Gutenberg-tm License.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
